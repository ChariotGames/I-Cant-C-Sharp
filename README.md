#  Intro
Are you ready to test your concentration like never before?

Our cute doodle-style game may seem easy to control, but trust us, it's harder than you think! With parallel mini-games that cover memory, reaction, cognition, and rhythm, you'll be hooked on the challenge. See for yourself how long your brain can last before its capacity fades out, only to become stronger for the next run.

Designed to simulate simple tasks, these mini-games come together to create an addictive and mind-bending experience. Come to our booth at HTW Berlin, H001 on 04.08.23 and put your concentration to the test. Let the concentration games begin!

# About 

As part of this semester's bachelor projects, our team picked the game-related Topic 'Konzentration durch Minispiele' (Fostering concentration via Minigames). The topic was very loosely defined: design a plethora of minimalistic play-elements that can be combined together to form complex, mind-boggeling (kinda) "games" to train concentration.<br>
The open nature of the topic allowed us to unleash our creativity and design skills, while being dreadful in terms of planning and agreement at times.

During some research and experimentation with the first game elements, we came to the agreement to make more than elements themselves, but still rather simple games and combine those. While on their own, most games may seem easy or even not engaging. But don't let that first impression fool you!<br>
By being virtually from different genres and requiring different kinds of attention, played in parallel they do require a certain amount of skills and a lots of concentration. With each additional game added to the roster, the chances for unexpected combinations and thus new challenge-ground for the mind arises.

## Features

- ### **Game-Modes**

The game is divided into two segments:<br>
The first is the single game mode, where each of our games can be played separately from others, allowing new players to familiarize themselves with each game and enjoy the hand crafted doodle graphics.<br>

<br>

Then there is the heart-pices: the parallel mode where you can play until you run out of hearts or your brain crashes down. In this mode, two randomly selected games of matching genres are displayed in parallel on the right and left side, respectively, and can be played simultaneously. See for yourself how long you can last.

- ### **Game Genres**

During our research and preparation for the project, we discovered four types of attention, which we used to define our game genres:

    - Reaction, games that test your reflexes;
    - Memory, (obviously) tests your memory (duh!:);
    - Cognition, tests your ability to deduce information;
    - Rhythm, tests your feel for the beat.

By being virtually from different genres and requiring different kinds of attention, played in parallel they do require a certain amount of skills and a lots of concentration. With each additional game added to the roster, the chances for unexpected combinations and thus new challenge-ground for the mind arises.

- ### **Adaptive Difficulty System**

Similarly, our game offers two ways of dealing with difficulty:<br>
The classic one, where you pick it yourself amongst the usual suspects found in most other games: easy, medium, and hard.<br>

![Options and Settings](./Assets/Promo/Options.png)


Or you can let the internal Game Manager do that for you, and try out our "Varying" mode - where the difficulty is upgraded dynamically the better the player is, and if you fail too often, the difficulty is downgraded.

- ### **Scores and Times**

What a great game can do without high scores, collecting points, and a pressuring timer? Exactly!<br>That's why we have them, too.

![Highscores](./Assets/Promo/Highscores.png)


But we used them for "scientific reasons." ;)<br>
The points incentivize you to stay engaged in playful testing of your concentration, while the high scores indirectly show your progression and improvement of concentration by constantly reaching higher values.<br>
Each game has its own designated timer - a dreaded sight at the beginning - to keep you at your toes. Then there is an overall play timer, a great measuring tool, showing your brain's endurance in the end.

### **An EasterEgg**

It is tradition that games contain some form of Easter Egg (historically, to promote the creator/s). Can you find it?
<br>
Hint: *You need to use your hightened concentration and focus on details ;)*
